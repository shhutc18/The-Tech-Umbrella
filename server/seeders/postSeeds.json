        "body": "Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future. Machine Learning is actively used in various fields, from medical diagnosis to financial market analysis.",
